    <h2>Description</h2>
    Arancini are a popular Italian street food made of bite-sized breaded and lightly fried spheres of risotto. 
    <p>Arancini take some effort to prepare but they are truly a delight to eat. This arancini recipe is perfect for snacking or serving as an appetizer with a simple Marinara Sauce. Or, they could easily make a whole meal when paired with a Lemon Parmesan Lettuce Salad or your favorite protein.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arbori rice</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Chicken broth</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Whisked eggs</li>
        <li>Plain panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 crushed, peeled garlic cloves and 1 finely chopped yellow onion.</li>
        <li>Stir until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice and toast  until semi-translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, 3 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves, 3 cups chicken broth, and 2 teaspoons tomato paste.</li>
        <li>dd 2 tablespoons of butter and bring to a soft boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the rice is tender and the broth is fully absorbed, turn off the heat and mix in 1/2 cup of grated parmesan.</li>
        <li>Carefully spread the rice onto a parchment-lined baking tray and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the rice is cool enough to handle, roll it into about 20 1-inch balls.</li>
        <li>Cut the 4 ounces of mozzarella into 20, 1/2-inch cubes. Stuff them into the center of each rice ball, closing them by gently pushing rice over the opening and reshaping the balls.</li>
        <li>In one medium mixing bowl, stir together 1/2 cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
        <li>In a second bowl, whisk 2 eggs. Add 2 cups of breadcrumbs to a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Dredge each ball in flour, then egg, then panko, and place on a clean parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 cups grapeseed or vegetable oil in an 8-inch saucepan to 350Â° F, or until the oil is bubbling but is not smoking.</li>
        <li>Fry 6 balls at a time, gently moving them around until golden in color, about 3-4 minutes. Place fried arancini on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Let cool for 5 minutes before serving with toothpicks or napkins on the side.</li>
    </ol>
